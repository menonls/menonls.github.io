# Features

The syringe pump delivers precise and smooth flow rates, essential for medical and laboratory applications. Key features include:
* Compatibility with 10 mL and 20 mL syringes without special tools.
* Motor-driven lead screw mechanism for fluid dispensing.
* Safety mechanisms like an end-of-stroke switch to prevent over-extension.
* Protected electronic components for durability and safety.

# Operating Instructions

* Fit filled syringes into the appropriate slots.
* Connect the Arduino board to a laptop and upload the AccelStepper code.
* Disconnect the Arduino from the laptop and connect it to the power supply.
* Plug the power supply into an outlet (yellow LED indicates idle state).
* Press the ON button to start the motor (green LED will light up).
* The motor will push the syringe plunger until it hits the OFF switch.
* Once the switch is triggered, the red LED lights up, and the motor stops.
