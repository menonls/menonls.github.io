# Design Process

The multimaterial pliers used TPU-90 as the central component with PLA for the snout and handles. By squeezing the handles, the central TPU square is elongated, causing the snout on the opposite side to pinch together. The hollowness of the snout allows for some bending to exist in the part, allowing the pliers to deform slightly to achieve a better grip along a greater area than what would be found in a filled in segment.

To a achieve a well-fitting TPU-PLA interface, the tolerances between the sperate components had to be tested. The first iteration had a gap of 0.5 mm in between the TPU-PLA ridges. While this slid in quite easily, it did not provide enough friction to keep the handles from slipping out of the TPU square. The second iteration was printed with no tolerance between parts. This was much better than the first iteration. Due to TPU's natural elasticity, The material deformed to fit and provided much more friction than the original.

To save material and time, only the outside border of the PLA handle and snout was printed. This in turn allowed the PLA to to bend as more force was applied on the handle, allowing the a greater area along the snout to touch together, rather than just the tip.

The TPU square went through a couple iterations. Originally, the center was cordoned off into squares in line with the outer square; however, this caused the deformation to not be in line with its diagonal, which is what was required to allow for the clamping mechanism to properly function. This was fixed by rotating the inner mesh by 45 degrees, allowing for a diagonal deformation.
